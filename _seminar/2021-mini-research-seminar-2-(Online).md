DANSIS  invite you to our second online mini research seminar with presentations of current research in fluid mechanics. The seminars will be a meeting between researchers at Danish universities and companies dealing with fluid mechanical processes. The presentations will mainly cover current or newly defended PhD projects.

This year the research seminar will be online only due to the COVID-19 Restrictions.

The seminar is split into a number of online seminars. This is the second seminar. 5 PhD students will present their research. More information and program will follow shortly.
