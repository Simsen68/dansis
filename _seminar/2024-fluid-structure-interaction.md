Fluid structure interaction is part of many applications and plays an important role in performance and durability of many product. 
Computation of Fluid Structure Interaction is far from trivial and requires stable nummerical models of both the fluid and structural part of the problem as well as suitable coupling algoritms.
In this seminar we will gain insights from some of the expects within the field from academia and industry in Denmark and abroad.
