Power-to-X involves converting surplus renewable energy into storable and transportable forms, such as hydrogen, synthetic fuels, chemicals and heat. As such Power-to-X technologies are at the forefront of sustainable energy transformation and play a critical role in balancing the future energy systems with multiple fluctuating energy sources.
Many of the challenges in developing Power-to-X technologies rely heavily on advanced fluid dynamics principles. Understanding fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and the interaction between different phases are essential for optimizing the performance and scalability of Power-to-X systems.

This seminar will offer insights into the latest advancements in Power-to-X technologies, with a focus on the fluid dynamics aspects that are crucial for their development. Experts from academia and industry will share their knowledge on topics such as electrolysis, catalytic processes, system integration and the role of fluid dynamics in enhancing the efficiency and stability of Power-to-X operations.

| 11:15 | **Alkaline water electrolysis: 3D multiphysics modelling** <br> *Ahsan Iqbal, Green Hydrogen Systems* <br> Alkaline water electrolysis has been used in H2 production for many years. In industries, the efficiency of electrolysis process is described by specific energy requirement i.e. kwh of electrical energy used to produce 1kg of H2. Theoretically at high temperatures efficiency of electrolysis is high. However, as of any other technology, AEW has its limitations e.g. use of diaphragm to separate anode and cathode. Diaphragm can only work under certain temperature. Therefore, properties of diaphragm are one of the factors that limits the operating temperature in AWE |
