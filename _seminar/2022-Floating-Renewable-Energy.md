Acceleration of the green transition is pushing renewable energy technologies to the limit. This seminar combines two areas of active research and development within green offshore energy; floating offshore wind turbine foundations and wave energy. Since both technologies are floating they share fluid dynamic properties and challenges.

Wind turbine parks are built further offshore and at higher water depths. This require new types of foundations and multiple companies are working on floating offshore foundations for very large wind turbines. One of those companies is Stiesdal Offshore Technologies and they will present how they tackled the complex fluid dynamics with lab scale test and CFD.

Wave energy has been long underway and is still missing a commercial breakthrough. Recent years a number of concepts have been tested with success and research within this field is gaining momentum. We will hear from some of the active players within wave energy both from industry and academia.

For practical reasons the seminar is split between DTU and DHI in Hørsholm. The first half of the seminar will take place at DTU and after lunch we relocate to DHI, where the seminar will proceed after a guided tour in the test facilities.
