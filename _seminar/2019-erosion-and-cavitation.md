Erosion occurs when solid or liquid particles impinge against material surfaces causing wear and geometry changes. Cavitation occurs when rapid changes of pressure in a liquid lead to formation and subsequent implosion of vapour bubbles.

Erosion and cavitation - both separately or in combination - may lead to severe performance degradation of fluid machinery or even failure, so understanding of the conditions under which these phenomena occur is essential for designing for greater durability.

DANSIS invites you to a seminar on erosion and cavitation with focus on how to improve understanding of the phenomena and how to apply simulation models . The scope of the presentations spans from state-of-the-art research to industrial research and application examples.

The seminar will be held at Grundfos in Bjerringbro.
