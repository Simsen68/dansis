Numerical simulations has an increasing impact on global companies research and development. Simulations yields potential competitive advantages, but also challenges as validation and managing the often sparse resources.

DANSIS invites you to a seminar on Implementing Quality and Trust in Modelling & Simulations at Tetra Pak – With some case studies. The focus of this seminar is to provide an insight into state of the art of virtual engineering.

After the seminar (around 15.50) we will have this years general assembly in the same online session.  Please note that the general assembly will be in Danish.
