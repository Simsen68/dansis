The new New Poul la Cour Tunnel at DTU Risø Campus was inaugurated. The wind tunnel is among the biggest university owned tunnels in the world, and the combination of test possibilities makes the wind tunnel one of a kind, not just nationally but globally.

DANSIS invites you to a visit to the wind tunnel combined with an exiting seminar on experimental aerodynamics within wind energy. The seminar contains a wide range of presentations from Danish and international experts. We have also set aside good time to visit the wind tunnel and talk to the scientists involved in development of the tunnel.
