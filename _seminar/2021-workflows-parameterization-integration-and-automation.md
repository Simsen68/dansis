A lot of focus is targeted on improving simulation models, both in terms of accuracy and computational cost. But actually a large part of a simulation specialists time is spend on the workflow surrounding the simulations. This seminar will focus on the surrounding  workflow.

Automation and integration of workflows has been an important development area for some of the worlds leading production companies. In this seminar we get insides on how they are working with improving the workflow and integrating simulations as a part of their organizations.

Automated workflows lead to new possibilities in terms of multidisciplinary and holistic design. We will hear from some of the leading experts within the field and be inspired to improve not only the simulation workflows, but also the final designs.
