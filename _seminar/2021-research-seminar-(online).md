DANSIS and FLUID•DTU host a series of research seminars with presentations of current research in fluid mechanics. The seminars will be a meeting between researchers at Danish universities and companies dealing with fluid mechanical processes. The presentations will mainly cover current or newly defended PhD projects.

### General information about Research Seminars
PhD students working on a current project and researchers that have defended a PhD degree within the last half year are invited to give a short (approximately 10 minutes) oral presentation of their research. Presentations could include both preliminary ideas for newly started PhD students and/or results in their more final form. Presentations should be in English.

The research should have a significant element of fluid mechanics. Furthermore, we encourage PhD students to bring a poster explaining key details of their work. There will be a poster session where the PhD students will be given the opportunity to discuss more details about their work.

A keynote presentation may also be invited by the organising committee.

As a presenter you will have the possibility to present your work for a significant part of the Danish fluid mechanics community. You may interact with both industry and academia and by this strengthen your network and open new possibilities.



### The application

If you would like to present your project, you should submit an application by sending an e-mail to the local organiser (Knud Erik Meyer, kem@mek.dtu.dk) with:

your name, title and affiliation
PhD project starting date and date of defense (if known)
name of your supervisor
titles of presentation and poster
a short (5-10 lines) description of your topic
Please submit your application before date stated under the research seminar. Presenters should then send a one page presentation of their project as a PDF file. This will be used for a printed proceeding. Further details on this written presentation will follow. We also ask presenters to let us publish their slides on the DANSIS website, www.dansis.dk

Participation
We encourage all members of the Danish fluid mechanics community to participate in the event. It will be a unique possibility to get an insight into ongoing research at Danish universities and to pass new knowledge and inspiration to your organisation. Moreover, you may also identify possible candidates for future job positions in your company.

If you want to participate in the meeting, you should register for the seminar at the DANSIS website. Members of DANSIS can participate in the seminar free of charge. Non-members are also invited to participate at a fee of 400 DKK. DANSIS will host an informal lunch. All participants will receive a copy of the printed proceedings.

The review committee will consist of members from the DANSIS board (representing nine companies and three universities) and from FLUID•DTU.
