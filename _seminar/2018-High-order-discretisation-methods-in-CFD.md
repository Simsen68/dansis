With the advent of super computers, we require higher and higher accuracy in the solution of many engineering problems. This has historically, in CFD, mainly been achieved by using a denser and denser grid in combination with a low order discretisation methods. However, to gain a much higher accuracy, for the same computer resources, we could increase the discretisation order while maintaining the grid density.

During the seminar, we will address the advantages of higher order discretisation methods. In addition, we will discuss mimetic or compatible discretisation methods, which are numerical schemes that largely mimic the continuous differential equation. Mimetic and high order discretisation schemes will be discussed individually and combined.
