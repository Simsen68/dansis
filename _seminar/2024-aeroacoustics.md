We often want to reduce noise generated from flows. Examples are wind turbines and fans. To reduce noise, the sources of the noise must be identified and the physical mechanisms must be analysed. One of the main purposes of the Poul la Cour Tunnel at Risø is to facilitate high quality measurements of aeroacoustics on airfoils at high Reynolds numbers. We will visit the wind tunnel and hear about at measurement techniques related to aeroacoutics. We will also get presentations about at computational methods and applications for wind turbines and fans.

Please contact the gatekeeper at Risø before you enter Risø Campus. State that you participate in the DANSIS seminar.

|  9:00 | **Registration and Coffee** |
|  9:30 | **Welcome** <br> *Knud Erik Meyer, DTU Construct, Denmark* |
|  9:40 | **Introduction to aeroacoutics** <br> *Franck Bertagnolio, DTU Wind Energy, Denmark* |
| 10:10 | **Establishment of an aeroacoustic wind tunnel** <br> *Christian Bak, DTU Wind Energy, Denmark* |
| 10:40 | **Coffee break** |
| 11:00 | **Beamforming for aeroacoustic measurements in wind tunnels** <br> *Pieter Sijtsma, PSA3, Netherlands* <br> This presentation discusses the localization and quantification of sound sources using microphone arrays, with an emphasis on the application in different types of wind tunnels. An overview is given of the challenges and the solutions that have been developed.|
| 11:40 | **Lunch and visit to Poul la Cour Tunnel** |
| 13:30 | **Computational methods for aeroacoustics** <br> *Roland Ewert, DLR, Germany* |
| 14:10 | **Trailing edge noise measurements on wind turbine blade sections** <br> *Andreas Fischer, DTU Wind Energy, Denmark* |
| 14:40 | **Coffee break** |
| 15:10 | **Aeroacoustic considerations in wind turbine design** <br> *Michael Asheim, SGRE, Denmark* <br> Aeracoustic considerations are critical for wind turbine generators as noise regulations can severely impact power production if not accounted for in the early stage of design. At Siemens Gamesa, developing and validating new aeroacoustic solutions is a vital part of maximizing the overall performance of SGRE wind turbines. |
