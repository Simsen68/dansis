We often want to reduce noise generated from flows. Examples are wind turbines and fans. To reduce noise, the sources of the noise must be identified and the physical mechanisms must be analysed. 
One of the main purposes of Poul la Cour Tunnel at Risø is to facility high quality measurements of aeroacoustics on airfoils at high Reynolds numbers. We will visit the tunnel and look at 
measurement techniques related to aeroacoutics. We will also look at computational methods and applications for wind turbines and fans.
