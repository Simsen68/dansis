We usually want to reduce noise generated from flows. Examples are wind turbines and fans. One of the main purposes of Poul la Cour Tunnel at 
Risø is to facility high quality measurements of aeroacoustics on airfoils at high Reynolds numbers. We will visit the tunnel and look at measurement techniques related to aeroacoutics. 
We will also look at computational methods and applications for wind turbines and fans.
