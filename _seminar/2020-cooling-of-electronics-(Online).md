For electrical devices like CPUs, smartphones or power electronics to function reliably it is highly important to avoid overheating. Large temperature deviations from nominal operation not only impact performance, they also constitute a risk from a lifetime perspective.

DANSIS invites you to a seminar on Cooling of Electronics. The focus of this seminar will be on providing attendees with a general introduction to cooling of electronics and its impact on reliability, but also give examples from academia and industry where various cooling and optimization strategies have been investigated or employed
